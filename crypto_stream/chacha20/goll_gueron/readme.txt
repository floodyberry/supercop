This code implements Daniel J. Bernstein's ChaCha stream cipher in C,
targeting architectures with AVX2 and future AVX512 vector extensions.

The implementation improves the slightly modified implementations of Ted Krovetz in the Chromium Project
(http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/nss/nss/lib/freebl/chacha20/chacha20_vec.c and
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/openssl/openssl/crypto/chacha/chacha_vec.c)
by using the Advanced Vector Extensions AVX2 and, if available in future, AVX512 to widen the vectorization
to 256-bit, respectively 512-bit.

On Intel's Haswell architecture this implementation (using AVX2) is almost ~2x faster than the fastest 
implementation here, when encrypting (decrypting) 2 blocks and more. Also, this implementation is expected 
to double the speed again, when encrypting (decrypting) 4 blocks and more, running on a future architecture
with support for AVX512.

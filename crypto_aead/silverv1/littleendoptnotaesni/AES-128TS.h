 * AES-128TS.h

 * @author Daniel Penazzi
 *
 * Optimised ANSI C code for AES with key of only 128 bits,
 *  Based on version 3.0 (December 2000)
 * of rijndael-alg-fst.h made by authors Vincent Rijmen 
 *  Antoon Bosselaers 
 * and Paulo Barreto 
 * however there are several significant changes explained in the .c file

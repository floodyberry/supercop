Changes from 20140924:

   * New crypto_aead/aezv3.
   * New blake2b/moon implementation.
   * New and updated chacha*/moon implementations.
   * Updated ntruees* checksums.
   * New and updated paeq* implementations.
   * Bug fix for *keyak, and optimized lakekeyak implementations.
   * Upgraded to GMP 6.0.0.

Changes from 20140910:

   * Portability fixes for */gil.
   * Updated kummer/avx.
   * Updated ntruees*.

Changes from 20140907:

   * New crypto_hash/shake256 and crypto_stream/rijn256ctr, which don't
     seem to work; similarly crypto_hash/keccakc512/gil. Please test
     your code in SUPERCOP before submission.

   * crypto_stream/*/dolbeau fixes.

   * New crypto_dh/ed448goldilocks and crypto_sign/ed448goldilocks.

   * New implementations of crypto_scalarmult/kummer.

   * New compiler lines.

   * data-run now removes previous implementations of a primitive from
     the .a file when it's integrating a faster new implementation.

Changes from 20140905:

   * ppae: tweaks, but still doesn't work.
   * elmd*: portability fix.
   * hs1*: "a couple of small bugs" fixed.
   * omd*: optimized implementations.
   * scream*, iscream*: NEON implementations.
   * tiaoxinv1: "aesnim" implementation.
   * Many more checksums.

Changes from 20140622:

   * Added gls254prot, copying the "prot" implementation from gls254.
     Please don't imitate this approach---it's just a temporary
     workaround for SUPERCOP not yet knowing how to separately benchmark
     protected implementations.

   * aes256ctr: new openssl and dolbeau implementations.

   * aes256gcmv1: new cryptopp and dolbeau implementations.

   * calicov8: define CRYPTO_NOOVERLAP; now compiles.

   * chacha20: new dolbeau implementation.

   * elmd*: clean up definitions of u32 etc. (I still see trouble with
     clang compatibility on some machines; will look at this more.)

   * hs1sivhiv1: new dolbeau implementation.

   * joltikneq*: new vperm implementations.

   * salsa20: new dolbeau implementation.

   * sphincs256: protect against smlen<CRYPTO_BYTES.

Changes from 20140529:

   * New crypto_sign/sphincs256 and crypto_sign/ntrumls*.

   * New tiaoxinv1/table.

   * Updates to aescopav1/ref, *avalanche*, stribob192r1/xmm,
     aes128poetv1*, ppaev11/ref, joltikeq9696v1, kiasu*, cmcc*,
     crypto_scalarmult/kummer/neon.

   * Data flow from "used" (marking some primitives as subroutines used
     by other implementations) to "integrate". This forces some one-time
     recompilation but simplifies future updates of the subroutine list.

Changes from 20140529:

   * Minor fixes to paeq, cmcc, hs1sivhiv1.

   * aes128poet: Remove gf128mul at submitter's request. Add AES-NI
     implementations.

   * More clang options. (But only a few options per architecture: we
     don't want benchmarks to run forever. People who want to do heavy
     exploration of different optimization options should do it on their
     own and submit asm.)

Many machines are chugging along on 20140525 now.

Changes from 20140517:

   * crypto_aead: Updates to aegis, aesjambu, elmd500, enchilada, lac,
     morus, ppae, raviyoyla.

   * crypto_dh: Updates to gls254, kummer.

   * crypto_sign: Updates to 3icp, pflash1, rainbow*, tts6440.

   * Everything should work on big-endian machines now; but I still have
     to test this.

Changes from 20140517:

Many, many, many crypto_aead updates.

Miguel Montes points out that SUPERCOP doesn't work on big-endian
machines with the new checksum system, so for the moment please run it
only on little-endian machines. This will be fixed in the next release.

Changes from 20140514:

   * crypto_aead additions: aegis*, deoxys*, joltik*, kiasu* (with the
     submitted binaries removed), lacv11, tiaoxinv1.

   * Updated crypto_aead/ifeed* and crypto_aead/morus*. Also added many
     checksums from earlier submissions.

   * New crypto_encrypt/ntru*{401,439,593,743}*.

   * Another attempt to fix pi64cipher256v1/opt*.

   * Touch blake2b/blake2s implementations that needed -DSUPERCOP so
     that they're recompiled.

Changes from 20140425:

   * Allow crypto_aead_decrypt to use clen bytes as temporary storage,
     and allow forgeries to set mlen arbitrarily.

   * Add ascon*,calicov8,norx*,omdsha*,ppaev11*,stribob*,trivia* in
     crypto_aead. Update pi64cipher opt* implementations.

   * Declare randombytes in try.h to suppress warnings.

   * Speed up crypto_verify/try.c.

   * Define SUPERCOP for all compilation, not just measurements.

Changes from 20130419:

This is a major update, with an almost completely new test system that
checks memory safety and purity much more comprehensively than the old
system. Two examples:

   crypto_dh ecfp256i tryfails ... crypto_dh_keypair writes after output
   crypto_dh hecfp64e2i tryfails ... crypto_dh is nondeterministic

One specific issue is that previously there was an ambiguity in the API:
it wasn't clear whether the crypto_* implementation was responsible for
handling overlap ("aliasing") between inputs and outputs (e.g., someone
puts a temporary key into a buffer and then overwrites it with
ciphertext), or whether the user was responsible for avoiding overlap.
This is now generally resolved in favor of the first choice, safer for
the user. There are a few exceptions, for example to allow a memset+xor
implementation strategy for crypto_stream.

Some previous submissions fail the new tests. I modified some of these
(but not all), often (but not always) enough to pass the tests, perhaps
without changing the semantics otherwise. I've also touched most of the
ARM asm software to make it work on machines that default to Thumb 2.
Implementors are advised to carefully check the SUPERCOP versions of
their software. Directories with new or updated implementations:

The new test system also produces new checksums, so the usual speedup
from running "data-do" rather than "do" doesn't apply to this upgrade:
running tests will take a while. New results will be online eventually.
All implementors, even those not listed above, are encouraged to check
whether their software is successfully compiling, passing the new tests,
and achieving the expected speeds.

SUPERCOP users with small disks should note that crypto_aead is a rather
large directory and is going to end up bigger than crypto_hash. I've
been equipping my small benchmarking machines with 32GB SD cards (or
larger USB sticks) formatted with 10485760 inodes (about what you get by
default for a 160GB disk); this should be adequate for the moment. The
big SUPERCOP redesign coming up will instead have files stored on a
central cluster, so benchmarking machines won't need much storage.

Changes from supercop-20130126:

   * New crypto_sign/lattisigns512.
   * New crypto_dh/gls254.
   * New crypto_dh/kumfp{127,128}g.
   * New crypto_dh/hecfp{127i,128bk,128fkt,128i}.

Note to implementors: All .c files in the directory are separately
compiled and linked together, so if you have an include file that isn't
supposed to be separately compiled then you have to label it as .h,
.incl, etc., not .c.

Changes from supercop-20120928:

   * Data collection centralized in machineinfo/do.
   * Collect "cpb" (Turbo Core) status.
   * New BLAKE2 hash function.

Changes from supercop-20120908:

   * New neon-vperm implementation of Groestl-256.
   * New NEON implementation of Curve25519.
   * Various NEON-related cleanups.

There's no reason to re-run except on ARMs with NEON.

Changes from supercop-20120812:

   * New crypto_verify_8, replacing the ad-hoc crypto_verify_8
     implementations in various crypto_auth implementations.

   * New implementations of siphash24.

   * New NEON implementations of aes128ctr, salsa20, poly1305.

Changes from supercop-20120717:

   * New groestl256/neon-bitslice implementation.
   * Updated crypto_stream/chacha*/krovetz implementations.
   * New crypto_auth/siphash*/sandy implementations.
   * New crypto_auth/pyrhash (Python randomized hash).

Changes from supercop-20120709:

   * Updated implementations of groestl256 and groestl512.
   * Tweaked crypto_stream/chacha*/krovetz for portability.

I've also drafted

   http://bench.cr.yp.to/cpucycles/sheevaplug.html

with cycle-counting instructions for the SheevaPlug.

Changes from supercop-20120704:

   * New groestl256/neon-table implementation.
   * New chacha*/krovetz implementations.
   * Updated clang compiler lines.

There's also documentation of the crypto_auth API, and preliminary
results (not linked anywhere yet):

   http://bench.cr.yp.to/results-auth.html
   http://bench.cr.yp.to/call-auth.html

Changes from supercop-20120525:

   * New clang compiler lines.
   * Improved portability of arm11 implementations: removed NEON FPU
     declarations.
   * Added siphash24 and siphash48 (under crypto_auth, which will be
     joining the benchmarking web pages soon).

Changes from supercop-20120521:

   * "sh data-do" (but not yet "sh do") protects against compiler bugs
     that produce endless compiler error messages.
   * groestl256/thumb* is now marked as armeabi/thumb architecture.

Changes from supercop-20120414:

   * New Groestl implementations.
   * New Keccak implementations.

This could be the last chance to provide data to NIST to help them with
the SHA-3 selection; if you're behind on benchmark runs then this is a
great moment to catch up. Thanks to everyone who has contributed!

Changes from supercop-20120329:

   * Ported blake256/vect128-neon/*.s to hard-float.
   * Fixed missing quotes in CRYPTO_VERSION for bblake512.
   * Replaced keccak*/avr8asm with avr8asmc and avr8asmf.
   * Added fugue2.
   * Added many missing */architectures files.

Changes from supercop-20120316:

   * Added bblake512.
   * Updated crypto_dh/curve2251.
   * data-init is now scheduled on core 0 if the OS supports taskset or
     cpuset. This simplifies enabling cycle counters on CPUs that don't
     enable them by default; current worst offender is ARM.
   * More cycle counters: linux/perf_event.h, and big-endian MIPS.
   * More NEON compiler options.
   * Updated list in mgrostl256/designers.

Changes from supercop-20120310:

   * NEON implementations of round3jh*.
   * sources.new and data.new are now removed if the previous run is up
     to date (i.e., sources matches sources.new).
   * Cleanups in ed25519.

This isn't worth a re-run from 20120310 except on ARM platforms with
NEON (Cortex A8 etc.).

Changes from supercop-20120225:

   * New groestl256/avr8asm implementation.
   * More implementations of blake256 and blake512.
   * Updated rhash/ref implementation.

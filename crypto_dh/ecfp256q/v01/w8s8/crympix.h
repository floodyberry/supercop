 * This file is a part of the freeware CRYMPIX
 * CRYPTOGRAPHIC MULTIPRECISION SOFTWARE Library.
 * This software is initially designed and developed in the
 * Information System Strategy and Security Laboratory (IS3)
 * of Izmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH).
 *
 * CRYMPIX is engineered to provide a portable environment
 * for the implementation of the latest techniques in
 * computational number theory and cryptology.
 * The content can be modified with the sole condition
 * that this header is kept as is.
 * We provide no guarantee for the correctness and
 * completeness of this software.

 * </CENTER>
 *
 * CRYMPIX is engineered to provide a portable environment
 * for the implementation of the latest techniques in
 * computational number theory and cryptology.
 *
 * This library is built with C programming language and it is supposed to
 * comply with ANSI C Standard. (tested with GNU-GCC compiler)
 *
 * Further compiler and processor support will be considered in the next
 * stable release. Our present focus is on the full documentation of
 * the code. CRYMPIX doesn't have a specialized install utility for now.
 * You can compile each source file with your favorite C compiler.
 *
 * CRYMPIX development team uses Eclipse IDE along with its plugins CDT
 * (code development with C/C++) and Eclox (Doxygen and Graphviz wrapper).
 *
 * Your individual contributions to this library are welcome.

Blue Midnight Wish - 512 as submitted to NIST on 15 Sept 2009.
This is an un-optimized ARM NEON eBASH implementation (based on the SSE2 version for x86). Precompiled with GCC 4.3.3 for compilers that compiles incorrectly. 
Note: Search/replace of SSE intrinsics with NEON intrinsics in the optx86sse2 implementation.

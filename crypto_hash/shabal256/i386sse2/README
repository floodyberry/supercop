Shabal-256, under the eBASH API, optimized for 32-bit x86. This version
uses SSE2 opcodes, and thus will not run on any processor which does
not feature a SSE2 unit.

The code is meant to be freely redistributable and modifiable. There
is no known copyright or patent infringement claim on this code and
algorithm, and no plan to establish such a patent. In the words
of the eBASH call for submission web page, this means a level 0
of copyright protection, and a level 0 of patent protection.
